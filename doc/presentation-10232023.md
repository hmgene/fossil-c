Deep-time paleogenomics and the limits of DNA survival [[37797036]]
>Middle Pleistocene, i.e., >126 ka, are still rare because postmortem processes lead to successive degradation of DNA molecules into increasingly small fragments, making DNA recovery more difficult with age. Early and Middle Pleistocene DNA has, however, been recovered from remains and sediments in high-latitude permafrost (10–14) and lower latitude caves (15, 16), suggesting that deep-time genomics is feasible in ideal preservation environments

>  The primary chemical mechanism of DNA fragmentation is hydrolytic depurination. This process removes adenine or guanine bases, creating abasic sites that can be cleaved by β elimination (19; Fig. 2C), and leading to purine overrepresentation adjacent to strand breaks (20; Fig. 2E) and interior gaps (21). 

>Hydrolytic deamination, another common form of chemical damage, converts cytosine to uracil and is observed as thymine in sequencing data, or “C-to-T transitions” (Fig. 2C). Deamination occurs primarily near strand ends and in single-stranded DNA (17, 21, 22; Fig. 2E)
