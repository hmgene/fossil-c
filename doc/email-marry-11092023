Osteocytes are a prime vehicle for the retention of DNA into deep time. Many factors contribute to the preservation of osteocytes and their constituent molecules. First, they are completely encased in a dense bone matrix, rendering them inaccessible to other live cells, whether those of the organism’s own immune system or from invading bacteria (Noble BS, Reeve J. Osteocyte function, osteocyte death andbone fracture resistance. Mol Cell Endocrinol 2000;159:7–13.). Because they are encased within the bone matrix, they have limited access to oxygen, and are thus protected from oxidative damage (Noble BS. The osteocyte lineage. Arch Biochem Biophys 2008;473:106–11.). The rigid bone matrix also inhibits denaturation and the molecular swelling that accompanies cell death. (Trump BF, Berezsky IK, Chang SH, Phelps PC. The pathways of cell death: oncosis,

apoptosis and necrosis. Toxicol Pathol 1997;25:82–8.;   Semal P, Orban R. Collagen extraction from recent and fossil bones: quantitative

and qualitative aspects. J Arch Sci 1995;22:463–7.)

 

Second, because they are immobilized within the mineralized matrix, cell division is inhibited (Knothe Tate ML, Adamson JR, Tami AE, Bauer TW. Cells in focus—the osteocyte. Int. J Biochem Cell Biol 2004;36:1–8.)  These cells must last a lifetime, and they do so by essentially acquiring a senescent state, except when bone is damaged or depleted. Their DNA does not “unwind” for replication as in more physiologically active cells, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template Cell division is directly linked to telomere shortening, which contributes to cell (and organismal) death (Kong, CM, Lee, XW, Wang X. Telmonere shortening in human diseases. FEBS journal, 2013,  https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.12326).  This is greatly retarded in osteocytes that do not divide.

 

Third, osteocytes express apoptotic repressor proteins (Guo D, Bonewald LF. Advancing our understanding of osteocyte cell biology. Ther Adv Musculoskelet Dis 2009;1:87–96.).  Thus any molecules that may trigger cell destruction through apoptosis are inhibited in these cells.

 

Fourth, bone incorporates a mineral phase of microcrystalline apatite. Mineral crystals are known  to stabilize organic components, including DNA and proteins through adsorption, due to their great surface area/volume ratio (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0038071705000027; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304420301000858; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-4754.t01-1-00071) and also provide surfaces for adsorption of bacterial enzymes of decay, inhibiting their actions. (Butterfield NJ. Organic preservation of non-mineralizing organisms and the taphonomy

of the Burgess Shale. Palaeobiology 1990;16:272–86.;   Butterfield NJ. Exceptional fossil preservation and the Cambrian explosion. Integr Comp Biol 2003;43:166–77;).


Notes on stains:
Propidium iodide (PI) tells us cells are non-viable, ruling out modern contamination as a source. It also requires DNA to be double stranded. PI intercalates into the major groove of double-stranded DNA producing a highly fluorescent signal when excited at 488 nm with a broad emission centered around 600 nm. PI will bind all double stranded nucleic acids, and will bind double-stranded RNA..  Propidium iodide binds stoichiometrically to double-stranded nucleic acid, at the rate of 1 dye per 4-5 bases, allowing fluorescence intensity (above 630 nm) to be used as an indicator of cellular DNA content (McCarthy, R.C. and Fetterhoff, T.J. (1989) Arch. Pathos. Lab. Med. 113:658).

 DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) is a blue-fluorescent DNA stain that exhibits ~20-fold enhancement of fluorescence upon binding to AT regions of dsDNA. DAPI will also bind to RNA, though it is not as strongly fluorescent. Its emission shifts to around 500 nm when bound to RNA. DAPI associates with the minor groove of double stranded DNA, and binds preferentially  to the AT sequence of double stranded DNA. (DOI: 10.1101/pdb.prot5556).


Anti Histone H4.  Histone proteins complex with eukaryote DNA. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template.  The demonstration of histones in osteocytes recovered from dinosaurs eliminates the possibility that these are of microbial origin (ie, biofilm) and may elucidate the role of these proteins in stabilizing DNA over deep time.



Anti DS DNA monoclonal—reacts very weakly to ssDNA, but 95% reactivity to dsDNA .  (I am waiting to hear back from the company, but I believe this antibody reacts to the sugar-phosphate backbone of the molecule.  It is a monoclonal and so very specific. 



somewhere i read that there is a size limit below which PI and DAPI will not intercalate, but I cannot find that reference right now.  i will keep looking.



good luck with the new preps.
